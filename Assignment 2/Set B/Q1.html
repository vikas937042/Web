    <h1 style="font-size: 50PX;"><center> DUSSEHRA</center></h1>
    <h3 style="font-size: 25px;" >Why is Dussehra Celebrated?</h3>
    <p>Since, India is a land of diverse cultures and traditions, the festival of Dussehra is celebrated in different ways. The eastern and southern states celebrate Dussehra as the victory of Goddess Durga over the evil demon Mahishasura. It begins on the first day of Navratri and continues for nine days. <br>
        On the other hand, most northern and western states of India celebrate Dussehra as Lord Rama’s victory over Ravana. A long time ago, King Dasharatha wanted to crown Rama, his eldest son, as the King of Ayodhya. Everyone in the kingdom was happy about the decision and were eagerly awaiting the coronation ceremony. However, Queen Kaikeyi wanted her son Bharata to be the King of Ayodhya. So, on the eve of the ceremony, she claims two boons that King Dashratha had granted her years back. She demands that Rama should be exiled in the forests for fourteen years and asks for Bharata to be crowned as the King of Ayodhya. <br>King Dashratha had no choice but to grant her these boons. So, Lord Rama was sent into exile along with his wife Sita and his brother Lakshmana. For thirteen years, they sacrificed all royal luxuries and wandered in the forests. During their final year in exile, a Rakshasi by the name of Surpanakha tries to seduce the two brothers. She fails and then tries to kill Sita. However, Lakshmana stops her and cuts off her ears and nose. Wounded and humiliated, Surpanakha returns to her brother Ravana, the evil ruler of Lanka. </p>
